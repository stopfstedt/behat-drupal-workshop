# Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)

> BDD is an evolution of test-driven development (TDD) and acceptance-test driven design, and is intended to make these practices more accessible and intuitive to newcomers and experts alike.
> It shifts the vocabulary from being test-based to behaviour-based, and positions itself as a design philosophy.

## What It Is

* Software Development Methodology
* Evolved out of Test Driven Development (TDD)
* Development Principles + Tooling
* Origins: JBehave by Dan North

## Concepts and Principles

1. Describe the _behavior_ of the software to build (_user stories_)
2. State the intent and business value of the software to build (_feature description_)
3. Use business readable, domain-specific language in your spec that is understood by **all** participants in the development process (_ubiqitous language_)
4. _shared understanding_ and ownership of the software specification
5. Work from the _outside-in_ (spec to code)

## Tooling

A BDD framework will:

1. read the spec
2. break up user stories (_scenarios_) into steps
3. transfrom steps into parameters for tests
4. execute tests step-by-step
