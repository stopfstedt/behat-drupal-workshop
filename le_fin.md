# Closing thoughts

## The Good

* Gherkin
* PHP tooling in PHP
* The mighty "Drupal API" driver
* Documentation
* Module-specific sub-contexts

## The Bad

* Bugs
* ZombieJS driver - dead in the water?
* Selenium/PhantomJS "runs away"
* JavaScript handling

## Looking Ahead

* Behat v3 currently in Beta
* Adoption by Drupal Contrib?
* Continuous Integration and the Aquia Shared Hosting Environment
