# Requirements

This is a hands-on workshop.
So please bring a laptop,  with the following software already installed:


* A recent [Java](https://www.java.com/en/download/) runtime environment (JRE) or Java Development Kit (JDK). The `java` executable should be in your path.
You may check if Java is already installed by opening up your command-line terminal and running:

```
java -version
```

* PHP v5.3.5+, with the `php` executable in your path.

```
php -v
```

* The following PHP libraries must be installed and enabled:

    * `curl`
    * `mbstring`
    * `xml`

```
php -m
```

* [Git](http://git-scm.com/). The command line client will do, Windows users are encouraged to install [msysgit](http://msysgit.github.io/). Please make sure that the `git` executable is in your path.

```
git --version
```

* The [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) web browser.
* A text editor or IDE of your choice.


We'll go over installing Composer, Behat/Mink and Selenium as part of the workshop, so no need to set up these tools beforehand.
