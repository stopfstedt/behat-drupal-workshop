# "Time to do it yourself..."

## Where to start

First-timers may start by checking out the [Drupal Behat Boilerplate](https://github.com/ucsf-drupal/drupal-behat-boilerplate.git) repository, or by building a test project from scratch.


## Some Ideas

* Write a test feature for a search page
* Write a test feature that covers a View.
* Write a test feature that covers a custom Content Type.
* Write a test feature that covers a form.

### Tips

* Map out page regions in the Behat configuration first.
* DRY: Explore the step definitions provided by Mink `Behat\MinkExtension\Context\MinkContext.php` and the Drupal extension `Drupal\DrupalExtension\Context\DrupalContext.php ` before rolling your own.

## Discussion

* How far did you get in the allocated time?
* What worked?
* What was challenging?
* "Anything you want to share"
